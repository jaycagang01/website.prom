    <h2>Hisotry of Tambulig</h2>
    <p>Tambulig, a municipality in Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines, was officially established on December 27, 1957, through Executive Order No. 282 signed by President Carlos P. Garcia. The municipality was formed by combining 41 barangays from the neighboring towns of Aurora and Molave. Subsequently, the creation of the Municipality of Josefina resulted in the transfer of 13 barangays from Tambulig to the new municipality. Later, the Provincial Board of Zamboanga del Sur added three barangays to Tambulig, bringing the total to 31 barangays.The name "Tambulig" is believed to have originated from the term "Tambuli," referring to a type of horn made from a carabao horn or seashell. Another account suggests that the name combines "Tambul," the vernacular term for drum, and "Ilig," a pioneering Subanen hunter from the area. According to local legend, Ilig would play his drum during full moon evenings, and even after his departure, the sounds of his drum could still be heard, leading early settlers to refer to it as the "tambul ni Ilig" or "drum of Ilig."The area was originally inhabited by the Subanen people, who settled along riverbanks in inland regions. Following World War II, migrants, primarily from the Visayas islands, settled in the region. Together with the original inhabitants, these pioneers contributed to the development of Zamboanga del Sur into a culturally diverse province.</p>
